# The Fascinating World of Marine Life

Marine life is incredibly diverse, encompassing a wide range of organisms from the smallest plankton to the largest whales. The ocean covers over 70% of the Earth's surface[^1] and is home to an estimated 230,000 known species[^2]. However, scientists believe that there may be up to two million species yet to be discovered[^3].

## Importance of Marine Ecosystems

Marine ecosystems play a crucial role in regulating the Earth's climate[^4].
They also provide essential resources such as food, medicine, and tourism opportunities. Coral reefs, for instance, support about 25% of all marine species[^5].
Coral reefs are often referred to as the "rainforests of the sea" due to their biodiversity[^5]. Additionally, coral reefs protect coastlines from erosion and storm surges[^5].

### Threats to Marine Life

Despite their importance, marine ecosystems are under threat from various human activities such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change. Plastic pollution alone kills millions of marine animals every year[^6]. Protecting these ecosystems is vital for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring sustainable use of marine resources.
